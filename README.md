# Galois correspondence of covering spaces

I taught this course at Mathcamp 2019. It covers (pun intended) the covering space theory for graphs and surfaces and is meant to be an introduction to algebraic topology and its connection to group theory.
The prerequisites are group theory and basic minimal exposure to topology/analysis.
